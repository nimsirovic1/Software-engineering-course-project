# Software engineering course project

This project is the „Software engineering“ course project “Information system for Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo”. I was also the team leader on this project. My team worked on the module called “Exams”. We worked on a web application that has two types of users, professors and students. Professors can make a new exam, review created exams, review students who subscribed for the specific exam, edit and delete exams. Students can subscribe for an exam, review informations about the exam and much more. The web application is made using React, Node.js and MySQL database.

My team is called Charlie and you can find our project in reactapp/src/CHARLIE folder.

Backend for this project is in Software engineering course project-backend repository.
